# lingo-legend-csvs

CSVs for importing for language learning in the Lingo Legend app.

If any errors are spotted, please feel free to open a PR with the correction and more info. Some of these entries may have been done by hand, but others may have been done by using AI to read a site and then were manually checked as much as possible to to try to ensure accuracy.

- For example, Cursor with `claude-4-sonnet` was used to read [Bulbapedia: List of Japanese Pokémon names](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Japanese_Pokémon_names) for `japanese/pkmn/names.csv`. For `japanese/pkmn/moves.csv`, Cursor with `gpt-5-fast` was used to read and cross-reference between [Bulbapedia: List of moves in other langauges](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_moves_in_other_languages) and [Pokémon move list](https://pokemondb.net/move/all).
- For the Japanese food CSVs, a combination of AI, copy/paste, and hand-editing was used. Eventually it'd be nice to have a long cohesive list of sushi menu vocabulary, but that will take more work later.
